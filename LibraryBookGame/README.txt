				On startup, the application allows the user to choose between three tasks:
				a. Replacing books.
				b. Identifying areas.
				c. Finding call numbers.

				For Part 2, only Identifying Areas has been enabled.

				When the user selects Identifying Areas, the application runs a match the column game. The data is stored in a dictionary. The data stored is high level call numbers from 000 - 900 and their respective descriptions. 
				The user can click on a call number and whichever description they think is the correct one associated with the call number. The game will randomly alternate between matching call numbers to their descriptions and 
				then matching descriptions to call numbers. There is a timer of 30 seconds and the user can try get as many matches correct before the time runs out. For every correct match the user earns 10 points and for every incorrect 
				match the loser loses 5 points. There will only ever be 4 questions (either call numbers or their descriptions) and then 7 possible answers. 

				The gamification features added were that of the points system and a timer.
