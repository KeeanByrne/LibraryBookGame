				On startup, the application allows the user to choose between three tasks:
				a. Replacing books.
				b. Identifying areas.
				c. Finding call numbers.

				For Part 1, only Replacing books is enabled – the other 2 options have been disabled for now.

				When the user selects Replacing books, the application randomly generates 10
				different call numbers, and displays them to the user in a listbox.

				The application allows the user to reorder the call numbers in ascending order by dragging and dropping the generated call numbers from the left listbox to the right listbox, and the 
				application then checks whether the user got the ordering right.

				The gamification features added were that of the points system and a timer.

Preferably use Visual Studio 2022 and .NET Framework 4.8 to run this application. 

To run this application, you need to start the application. Upon starting the application you will be met with a starting screen. Clicking the "Get Started?" will take you to the main page where you will be presented with 
the "Replacing Books" game. To learn how to play the game, click the "How to Play?" button. Clicking start will display 10 randomly generated call numbers, and start a 30 second timer, for you to sort by dragging and dropping 
each call number in ascending order from the listbox on the left over to the listbox on the right. Each correct placement is worth 10 points.
